# FerroSim

To use, run
`python setup.py install`

and then
`python run_main.py`

This will run the simulation. You can change simulation parameters by passing them to Ferro2DSim() when instiantiating the class. Change things including number of defects, strength of built-in field, size of simulation, kinetic coefficeint, alpha and beta from teh Landau expansion, and more (see simclass.py for details).
